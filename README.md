This is a very usefull way to get information, plots and maps if you are interested on co2 emissions, climate change, renewable energies, etc. 
It is amazing to see the continious rise in CO2 emissions to the atmosphere being the main contributers the power generation and transport sectors. 
If you pay close attention to the plot where you can se the global emissions, there is a evident decrease in emissions in 2020 due to the pandemic. However, as soon the lockdown ended emissions started to rise....
This is a first step of what I want to do with this data, I am currently working on a predictive model to estimate CO2 emission trends in the future.
